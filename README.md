## Configuration
Fork this repo; Rename `config.example.json` file to `config.json` then edit and modify the first lines with your settings:

- coin: the name of the coin (LISK, ARK, SHIFT, RISE, or whatever you want)
- node: the lisk node where you get forging info
- nodepay: the lisk node used for payments
- pubkey: your delegate pubkey
- percentage: percentage to distribute
- logfile: file where you want to write pending and sent amounts
- minpayout: the minimum amount for a payout
- secret: your secret
- secondsecret: your second secret or null if disabled
- feededuct: true if you want to subtract fees from user payouts
- donations: a list of object (address: amount) for send static amount every payout
- donationspercentage: a list of object (address: percentage) for send static percentage every payout
- skip: a list of address to skip
- private: set to true for private pool
- whitelist: put a list of address you wish to include in private pool

Now edit docs/index.html and customize the webpage.

Finally edit poollogs.json and put in lastpayout the unixtimestamp of your last payout or the
date of pool starting;

### Private pool
If you want to run a private pool, you need to edit config.json and:

- private: set to true
- whitelist: put a list of address you wish to include

## Running it

First clone the shift-pool repository and install requests:

```git clone https://github.com/MxShift/shift-pool.git```

```cd shift-pool```

```sudo apt-get install python3```

```sudo apt-get install python3-pip```

```sudo pip3 install requests```

Then start it:

```python3 liskpool.py```

or if you want to use another config file:

```python3 liskpool.py -c config2.json```

The script is also runnable by cron using the -y argument:

`python3 liskpool.py -y`

It produces a file "payments.sh" with all payments shell commands. Run this file with:

```bash payments.sh```

The payments will be broadcasted (every 10 seconds). At the end you can move your generated
poollogs.json to docs/poollogs.json and send the update to your git repo.

```
git add docs/poollogs.json
git commit -m "payouts update"
git push -u origin master
```
or

```bash site-update.sh```

To display the pool frontend, enable docs-site on github repository settings.


## Batch mode

**There is also a 'run.sh' file which run liskpool, then payments.sh and copy the poollogs.json
in the docs folder.**

```bash run.sh```

### Avoid vote hoppers

In some DPOS, some voters switch their voting weight from one delegate to another for
receiving payout from multiple pools. A solution for that is the following flow:

1. Run liskpool.py every hour with --min-payout=1000000 (a very high minpayout, so no payouts will be done but the pending will be updated)
```
crontab -e
@hourly python3 ~/shift-pool/liskpool.py -y --min-payout=1000000
```
2. Run liskpool.py normally to broadcast the payments

```bash run.sh```

## Command line usage

```
usage: liskpool.py [-h] [-c config.json] [-y] [--min-payout MINPAYOUT]

DPOS delegate pool script

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c config.json        set a config file (default: config.json)
  -y                    automatic yes for log saving (default: no)
  --min-payout MINPAYOUT
                        override the minpayout value from config file
```
